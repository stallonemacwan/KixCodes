KixCodes in the Netherlands


In The Netherlands we have PostNL, the postal company. They use KixCodes, a fast way to deliver letters and packages that can be scanned during the process.

Kix Code

The code is a combination of: "Postal code", "House/box/call number" and "House appendage / suffix"

If there is a character between the house number and the suffix, we need to replace that with an X. Eventually, the code will be printed in the KixCode font.
